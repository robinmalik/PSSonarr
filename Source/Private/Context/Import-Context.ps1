function Import-Context
{
	<#
		.SYNOPSIS
			Resolves and imports the active context.

		.DESCRIPTION
			This function retrieves the active context from disk or memory and returns it as a PSCustomObject.
			It is used internally by other module functions to determine which Sonarr instance to target.

			Resolves the active context from (in priority order):
			1. In-memory ephemeral context (Save-SonarrContext -Persist $false)
			2. In-session name override (Select-SonarrContext -Persist $false)
			3. Persisted active context marker file
			4. Persisted context file on disk

			If no context is found, an error is thrown.

		.OUTPUTS
			PSCustomObject containing the active context.

		.NOTES
			This is a private function used internally by other module functions.
