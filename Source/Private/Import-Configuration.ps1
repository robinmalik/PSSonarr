		.SYNOPSIS
			Loads the active context into the module-scoped $Config variable.

		.DESCRIPTION
			Every public function calls this before making a request. The active context is resolved by
			Import-Context and stored in $Script:Config, which Invoke-SonarrRequest reads to build the URI
			and headers.

		.NOTES
			This is a private function used internally by other module functions.
